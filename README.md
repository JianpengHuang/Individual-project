# MA705 Final Project

The project is about the prices of over three hundred used sports cars from the year 2015 to 2023 on www.truecar.com. The project allows a user to find the prices of a sports car from year to year. We know that luxury cars usually depreciate so much in the first couple of years. In the dashboard, the scatter plot can show the prices of a sports car over years based on a user’s input. The scatter plot can show a range of prices of a car model in select years. 

If a client is looking for a sports car and wants to enjoy a car that has less depreciation, the scatter plot can help this client to find a car in what year would have lower depreciation. Also, the scatter plot shows how much depreciation a client owns for a car for a certain period. 


The final dashboard is deployed on Heroku [here](https://jianpenghuang.herokuapp.com).

## Dashboard Description

The dashboard summarizeds the information of over three hundred used cars obtained from www.truecar.com. It allows users to find an used car price and compare prices of a car over years.

Also, the dashboard allows users to see the depreciation of a car over years.

### Data Sources

All the used car data is from the TrueCar website. https://www.truecar.com/

I used the web scraping function to collect data directly from the TrueCar website. I was able to capture 30 cars at a time. I’ve tried to run a code to capture more cars at a time, but my code was not working. Therefore, I wrote different codes to gather data from different car brands.


### Other Comments

Overall, I think this project is fun and this is what I have been trying to do. I am looking forward to buying a luxury used or new sports car. I wish to keep a car for three years. However, I want to know the depreciation cost of a car and compare it to leasing a sports car. This project could answer my question by seeing my favorite sports car prices ranging from a year to year.
